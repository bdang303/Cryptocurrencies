# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

This project consisted of taking a data set of Cryptocurrencies and various data elements associated with them such as total cryptocurrencies mined, total supply, and essentially whether or not they are tradable. 

## Results

By preprocessing the Crypto dataset for PCA, we then reduced the data dimensions and were able to create clusters for the 532 various cryptocurrencies included in the data set.
